## Test App for React Navigation and Screens

This is a simple project for me to test:

- [React Native 0.57.x](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/tree/0.57-stable)
- [React Navigation 3.x](https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation)
- [React Native Screens](https://github.com/kmagiera/react-native-screens)
- [Fluid Transitions](https://github.com/fram-x/FluidTransitions), with a [patch-package](https://github.com/ds300/patch-package) script while waiting for [this to land & be released](https://github.com/fram-x/FluidTransitions/pull/128).

Feel free to mess around with it and LMK if you have any feedback using the issue section of the repo :)
